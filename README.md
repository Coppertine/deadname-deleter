Configuration
===
(Requires Mod Configuration)
You can easily configure what username you want to set yourself as throughout the game.
- Download [Mod Configuration](https://github.com/reckdave/Mod-Configuration/releases) and place (*Not Extract*) the `.zip` file into `%appdata%/KinitoPET/Mods`
- Run the game at least once with both Mod Configuration and Deadname Deleter installed.
- Edit the values through one of two ways below:
  
### Mod Configuration GUI
- Open the `Mod Config` app in KinitoPET and modify values as you wish.
- Close the `Mod Config` app and restart the game.
### Mod Configuration json file
- Close the game and head into `%appdata%/KinitoPET/config` and open the `deadname-deleter.json` file in your favourite text editor (Notepad works, but make sure it's saved as `.json` and not `.json.txt`).
- Modify any value, save the file and re-launch the game.

Refer to the [Configuration Page](https://github.com/Coppertine/deadname-deleter/wiki/Configuration#values) for more information

Aknowledgements
===
Thank you [reckdave](https://github.com/reckdave) for helping out with mod development, I could not be here without your support (and the Mod Configuration mod of course).

Although 90% of the code is of my own, a lot of KinitoPET modding requires replacement of particular parts of the game. Therefore, some parts of each mod comes from the original mod.
These are only used as replacements and will not work without being loaded as a mod into the game. Therefore.. just buy the game if you haven't.
